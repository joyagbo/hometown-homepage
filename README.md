# Kainji Tourism Portal

## 📌 Project Overview

This project is a **solo assignment** for my web development course. It is a landing page dedicated to **Kainji**, a unique town in **Niger State, Nigeria**. The website highlights the town's **history, wildlife, and engineering significance**, with a strong focus on:

* **Kainji Lake National Park**
* **Kainji Hydroelectric Dam**

The primary goal of this project was to practice **HTML5 semantic structure** and **CSS3 Flexbox** to create a **responsive, modern layout**.

## 🎨 Design Inspiration

The layout was inspired by a modern **hometown homepage** design. I adapted the structure to reflect the **cultural and natural identity of Kainji**, transitioning from a standard block layout to a more dynamic, centered design using `width: fit-content` for badge-style elements.

## 📝 Learning Outcomes

Through this project, I gained hands-on experience with:

* Using `display: flex` for both horizontal and vertical alignment
* Creating perfectly circular images using `border-radius: 50%` and `object-fit: cover`
* Writing clean, readable code with **semantic HTML**
* Solving layout issues such as unwanted element stretching in block-level components
