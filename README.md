# Kainji Tourism Portal

## Project Overview

This project is a **solo assignment** for my web development course. It is a landing page dedicated to **Kainji**, a unique town in **Niger State, Nigeria**. The website highlights the town's **history, wildlife, and engineering significance**, with a strong focus on:

* **Kainji Lake National Park**
* **Kainji Hydroelectric Dam**

The primary goal of this project was to practice **HTML5 semantic structure** and **CSS3 Flexbox** to create a **responsive, modern layout**.

## Design Inspiration

The layout and visual style of this project were inspired by a **Figma homepage design titled *"Hometown Homepage"***.

🔗 **Figma Design Link:**
[https://www.figma.com/design/2QuGfAOcHaZJ6aHXfuamnK/Hometown-Homepage?node-id=121-2&t=qFSdIcko2qy62Pxg-0](https://www.figma.com/design/2QuGfAOcHaZJ6aHXfuamnK/Hometown-Homepage?node-id=121-2&t=qFSdIcko2qy62Pxg-0)

This Figma file influenced the overall structure and visual direction of the project, particularly:

* Hero section layout and hierarchy
* Section spacing and content flow
* Card-based grid layouts
* Hover and interaction design cues

## Learning Outcomes

Through this project, I gained hands-on experience with:

* Using `display: flex` for both horizontal and vertical alignment
* Creating perfectly circular images using `border-radius: 50%` and `object-fit: cover`
* Writing clean, readable code with **semantic HTML**
* Solving layout issues such as unwanted element stretching in block-level components
